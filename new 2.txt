Program: Assertion method Assert.assertArrayEquals() example.
Java Class: org.junit.Assert

Assert class provides a set of assertion methods useful for writing tests.

assertArrayEquals() method checks that two object arrays are equal or not. 
If they are not, it throws an AssertionError with the given message. 
Incase if expected input and actual inputs are null, then they are considered to be equal. 
It checks whether both arrays are having same number of elements or not, 
and all elements should be same. It compares based on the order. 
If mismatch in order results in failure.

import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
 
public class MyAssertArrayEqualsTest {
 
    @Test
    public void myTestMethod(){
        /**
         * we are demonstrating the usage of assertArrayEquals()
         * method here, so we are preparing input data here itself.
         * In real scenario, we will consider the methods returned 
         * value which suppose to be test, as a input. 
         */
        //assume that the below array represents expected result
        String[] expectedOutput = {"apple", "mango", "grape"};
        //assuem that the below array is returned from the method 
        //to be tested.
        String[] methodOutput = {"apple", "mango", "grape"};
        assertArrayEquals(expectedOutput, methodOutput);
    }
